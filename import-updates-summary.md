# Import Path Updates Summary

## Changes Made

1. Created and executed a script `fix-imports.sh` to automatically update import paths in TypeScript files.
2. Converted relative imports to absolute imports with the `@/` prefix, following Next.js 15 conventions.
3. Manually updated specific files with complex import paths:
   - `src/lib/redux/features/fileSlice.ts`
   - `src/components/Navbar.tsx`
   - `src/components/FileUploader.tsx`
   - `src/lib/providers.tsx`

## Examples of Updates

### Before:
```tsx
import { filesApi } from '../../api';
import { FileData, UploadResponse } from '../../types';
import CustomButton from 'CustomButton';
import { store } from 'redux/store';
```

### After:
```tsx
import { filesApi } from '@/lib/api';
import { FileData, UploadResponse } from '@/lib/types';
import CustomButton from '@/components/CustomButton';
import { store } from '@/lib/redux/store';
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All imports now follow the same pattern with the `@/` prefix.
2. **Maintainability**: Absolute imports are easier to maintain when files are moved around.
3. **Readability**: Clear indication of where imports are coming from in the project structure.
4. **Alignment with Next.js 15**: Following the recommended import conventions of Next.js 15.

## Notes

- Backend code (in the `backend/src/` directory) was not modified as it follows a different import convention.
- External library imports (from 'react', 'next/link', etc.) were left unchanged.
