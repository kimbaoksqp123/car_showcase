# Project Restructuring Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Directory Structure Reorganization**
   - Moved all code to `/src` directory following Next.js 15 conventions
   - Structured folders as:
     - `/src/app` - Pages and routes
     - `/src/components` - UI components
     - `/src/lib` - Utilities and shared code
     - `/src/utils` - Helper functions
     - `/src/constants` - Constants and static data

2. **Import Path Updates**
   - Updated all relative imports to absolute imports with `@/` prefix
   - Created a script to automate import path conversions
   - Manually fixed complex imports

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to support the new structure
   - Ensured `next.config.js` is properly configured for image domains

4. **Cleanup**
   - Removed duplicate files and directories
   - Removed temporary utility files used during migration
   - Updated documentation to reflect new structure

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: Clearer separation of concerns with a standardized directory structure
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Absolute imports make code more maintainable when files are moved
3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Consistent import patterns and file locations
4. **Future-Proof**: Aligned with Next.js 15 best practices and recommendations

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all tests pass with the new structure
2. Review and update any CI/CD configurations if necessary
3. Consider automated linting rules to enforce the new import conventions
